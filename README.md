# BUILDING A MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

This is a self-project done by me Chibuike Victor Akujuobi and reviewed by my friends Teyira Peter Geo-Needam and Emmanuel Ugochukwu. This project was done to enable us to strengthen our skills in Python and Machine learning.

## Project Overview
This Movie Recommendation System is a web application that suggests movies based on user input. It combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations. The system also fetches movie information from the OMDB API and provides links to YouTube trailers for the recommended movies.

## Project Steps
1. **Library Import:** We import the necessary Python libraries, including Flask for building the web app, pandas for data handling, scikit-learn for feature extraction, fuzzywuzzy for fuzzy string matching, requests for API calls, and the Google API Client for YouTube integration.

2. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** We load and preprocess the movie dataset from a CSV file. The dataset includes information about movies, such as genres, keywords, cast, and directors. Missing values are handled, and a combined feature is created for text-based analysis.

3. **Feature Selection:** We use TF-IDF vectorization to convert the textual features into numerical vectors, which are used for content-based recommendations.

4. **Content-Based Recommendations:** We use fuzzy matching and cosine similarity to find movies similar to the user's input. The content-based recommendations are based on textual features like genres, keywords, and cast.

5. **Collaborative Filtering Recommendations:** Collaborative filtering recommendations are provided if available. These recommendations are based on user ratings and preferences.

6. **Hybrid Recommendations:** We combine both content-based and collaborative filtering recommendations using a weighted approach. Users can adjust the weight of each recommendation type to customize their results.
